46.003153,-115.628909,<h3>Wildfires in the US Northwest</h3>,"<h4>Washinton, Montana, Oregon, Wyoming, and Idaho</h4>","The fire season, generally, begins at the end of spring and persists into the fall. On some occasions, however, the fires will persist until the first snow fall of the season. The northwest includes states such as Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Montana, but other states, such as California, Colorado, and (occasionally) Arizona, also suffer from frequent wildfires. Due to these fires, Indigenous communities may suffer from loss of economical income, their livelihoods, their homes, family members, livestock, and many other factors. Some of the most detrimental fires in recent years to federally recognized tribes includes the Spotted Eagle Fire (MT), Carpenter Road Fire (WA), Cougar Creek Fire (WA), and the North Star Fire (WA).","<a href='sites/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest.html'> MORE DETAILS</a>"
